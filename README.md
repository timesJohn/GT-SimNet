# GT-SimNet: Improving Code Automatic Summarization via Multi-modal Similarity Networks
GT-SimNet Source Code Summarization Method - Public Release

This repository contains the public release code for GT-SimNet, a method for source code summarization. Code summarization is the task of automatically generating natural language descriptions of source code.
## Requirement
This repository is developed based on the environment of:
* Python 3.6
* PyTorch 1.5
## Update Notice
This repository relies on the paper - GT-SimNet: Improving Code Automatic Summarization via Multi-modal Similarity Networks, which is currently submitted to the Journal of Systems and Software (JSS). We will publish the corresponding source code after the article is accepted.
