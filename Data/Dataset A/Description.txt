The dataset used for the paper experiments contains the following folders:

train: Contains all the training (.java) files

test: Contains all the test (.java) files

json: Contains a parsed form of the data, that can be easily input into machine learning models. 


The format of the json files is explained below.
========================== JSON file format ==========================
Each .json file is a list of methods.

Each method is described by a dictionary that contains the following key-value pairs:
 filename: the origin of the method
 name: a list of the normalized subtokens of the method name
 tokens: a list of the tokens of the code within the body of the method. The code tokens are padded with a special <SENTENCE_START> and <SENTENCE_END> symbol. Source code identifiers (ie. variable, method and type names) are
annotated by surrounding them with `<id>` and `</id>` tags. These tags were removed as a preprocessing step in this paper.
